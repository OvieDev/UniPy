## Why you should report vulnerabilties
Well, UniPy is a cryptocurrency system. It basically allows to transfer "funds" from user to user. Although, currencies are just a few bits aligned together, some people (including me) think that those coins have a value\
So, it will make this system fair and (most importantly) decentralized for everyone.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
First - is that issue potentially destructive? If yes, then you shouldn't report it on Issues, rather message me (OvieDev) or any other contributor about this issue.\
If it isn't really destructive, then go ahead report it on Issues.\
______________________________\
Then, provide as many details, as you can about the problem. So:
- What is this problem
- Why is this an issue
- How it can be fixed (if you know something about programming and you have a source code)
- What do you need to do, to replicate the issue
- Tell how dangerous the issue is (rate it from 1-10 etc.)

*Also note, that from a very theoretical point of view, cryptocurrencies are sort of "unhackable". Like the key of cryptocurrencies is an encryption. Sooo, this thing shouldn't even exist. But you know. Everything that makes user experience worse, is considered as a vulnerability*
