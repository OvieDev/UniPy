# UniPy
UniPy is a cryptocurrency network. It aims to be more ecofriendly, less hardware dependant system for sending money. This repo is a client for UniPy. You can connect to the network using this thing. 

# Philosophy
UniPy's philosophy is basically pretty simple. Everything is created by users, for users. Everything that should not be constant, is not constant. UniPy uses a lot of already made algorithms and solutions, but also makes sure, that there's a bit of originality to every aspect of that network. Instead of mining by proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, UniPy tries to make mining look more like learning. UniPy also aims to be more ecofriendly, by (as stated before) using less power-intensive solutions.
# State of the project
At the moment, project does not support peer2peer connection, rather it's a preview how this project should look like. If you really want to help making this project into actual network, you should start looking at the `development` branch. If you want to implement cool features, or make the system more safe, you can contribute to `master`.
