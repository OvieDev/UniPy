# How to contribute?
## Step one: Select a branch
First, decide to what branch you want to contribute. `master` or `development`. Master branch at the moment works as a preview for features, that will be aviable in the final version of the network. 
Development branch on the other hand aims to actually create a network. So, pick a branch first.

## Step two: Fork the project, add some features and create a pull request
After you forked the project and added some cool features you should create a pull request. Give it a nice, descriptive title and (optional) add some tags.
Then, fill the body. Describe what your commit solves, fixes etc. and add some checkboxes to see what things your pull request adds, removes, solves etc. \
Template:
|Checkbox | Feature                       |
|---------  |-----------------------------|
| ✔        | It adds some new features    |
|❌        | It removes a thing           |
|❌        | Makes system more secure     |
|✔         | Solves very important problem|
Of course this is just a template, so you can give your own fields to the table.

## Step three: Wait for your PR to be merged
Now, you've to wait for review of you pull request. This can take some time, but sometime in the future, your project would be merged. \
